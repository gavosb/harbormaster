## harbormaster
The Harbormaster is a Discord bot for The Maritime Federation discord server.

# Features
Dynamic databases, simple voting, blacklists for player reference, and an enhanced discord experience. Planned to have pyborg integration, in-game weather prediction, national anthem/music playing, and military simulations for the sci-fi aspects.


# DIRECTIONS
To use this code for your own use, you will need to have a .env file containing: DISCORD_TOKEN=(bot token)

(bot token) must be replaced with the bot's auth token given by discord.

Other prerequisites include the discord.py, aiosqlite, pyborg, and python-dotenv packages.
